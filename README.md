# DungeonGeneratorV1

This is the first project where I implemented whatever what I learned about C++ up to that point.
What I originally set out to do is make a program that can generate layouts for dungeons.
Currently it outputs 10 rooms. 1 of which is a set starting room. The rest have a random size, amount of monsters, chests, and traps.
The rooms are then connected and a map is generated to show the arrangement of the rooms. Each adjacent room has doors connecting them.

There are ways that I can improve this still, but I decided it was good enough a solution for the original goal I set myself.
So I will be moving on to other projects. I do like the final product I came up with. Maybe it will be useful in the future!
