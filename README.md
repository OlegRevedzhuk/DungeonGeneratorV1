# DungeonGeneratorV1

This is an ongoing project where I try to implement whatever I am currently learning.
The program itself is supposed to generate a dungeon layout and print it to the console.
Currently it outputs 10 rooms. 1 of which is a set starting room. The rest have a random size, amount of monsters, chests, and traps.
The rooms are then connected and a map is generated to show the arrangement of the rooms. Each adjacent room has doors connecting them.
